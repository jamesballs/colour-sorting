# colour-sorting
A visual representation of sorting algorithms using colours.

# Disclamer
Only bubble sort works at the moment. Not currently planning to add anything else, but the infrastructure is there for others to contribute.

# Usage
Open the program and press start next to the bubble sort label and watch the colours fly!
